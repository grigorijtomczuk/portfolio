## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Run this command in the project root to install all dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

### Building and Running

The following command will create an optimized production build of the application in the `dist` folder (the build path can be set in `.env`):

```
$ npm run build
```

To run the application in development mode on your localhost use this command:

```
$ npm run dev
```

### Deployment

To deploy the application on your GitHub Pages, fork the original repository, then run this command:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

Then, go to your `multipage-portfolio` fork settings and under the Pages tab set the deployment source to "branch", then choose the `dist` branch. In this way, the deployed application directory will be sourced from the `dist` branch of your fork.
